## Introduction
We will continue to look at the existence and uniqueness theorem, following the previous module, particularly on **uniqueness**. We will discuss Bellman-Gronwall lemma, a tool that we use to prove a uniqueness of a function, when we have some ideas that a function is a solution to an ODE.
